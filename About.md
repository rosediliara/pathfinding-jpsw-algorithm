## About ##

You have reached Daniel Harabor's code repository. If you would like to know about me or my work (or are simply looking for copies of published papers) please visit my 
[homepage](https://harabor.net/daniel).

Some things that are hosted in this repository:

| Path | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| [warthog](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/warthog/) | Fast implementations of various pathfinding algorithms including Jump Point Search and JPS+. |
| [anyangle](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/anyangle/) | Fast implementations of Anya and Polyanya, two techniques for optimal any-angle pathfinding |
| other | |
| ├ [jump_point_graphs](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/other/jump_point_graphs/) | A graph-specific reinterpretation of Jump Point Search.  |
| ├ [gppc-2013](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/other/gppc-2013/) | Competitor codes from the 2013 Grid-based Path Planning Competition.
| └ [gppc-2014](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/other/gppc-2014/) | Competitor codes from the 2014 Grid-based Path Planning Competition.
| ├ [hog](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/other/hog/) | A highly modified implementation of Hierarchical Open Graph v1. |
| └ [topping](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/src/master/other/topping/) | An implementation of Two Oracle Path PlannING (Topping).  |

To test these implementations I use a variety of benchmark problem sets, which you can find [here](https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/benchmarks/)

My development platform is Linux 20.04 with most of the code here being written in C++. When compiling I recommend that platform together with GCC 9.3.0. In the past I have successfully compiled and executed the same code on OSX (most recently macOS 10.13).
