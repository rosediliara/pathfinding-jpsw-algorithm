## Compiling

Run `make all` in the root directory (or `make fast` to compile with
optimisations). This has been tested with recent versions of g++ (5+) on
recent versions of Linux (Ubuntu 16.04+, Arch Linux). This should
build `bin/scenariorunner` and `bin/test`.


## Example usage

After compiling, you can run a small example (Arena from Dragon Age: Origins)
with the command below:

```bash
./bin/scenariorunner ./meshes/arena.mesh ./scenarios/arena.scen
```


# Generating meshes from grids

CDT, M-CDT and Rect are defined in section 5 of our paper.

These rely on utilities in the `utils` directory. Grid to CDT requires the use
of the Fade2D library and GMP, which has only been tested on Linux.
Commercial use of Fade2D requires a valid commercial license.

Ensure that GMP is installed (`sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev` on Ubuntu),
change directory into `utils`, and run `make fast`.

## Grid to CDT

In the `utils` folder,

```bash
./scripts/gridmap2mesh.sh < ./maps/arena.map
```

will convert a grid map of Arena from Dragon Age: Origins to a CDT mesh, output
to standard output.

### CDT to M-CDT

In the `utils` folder,

```bash
./bin/meshmerger < ../meshes/arena.mesh
```

will convert a CDT mesh of Arena from Dragon Age: Origins to a M-CDT mesh,
output to standard output. The `meshmerger` utility works for any kind of mesh.

## Grid to Rect

In the `utils` folder,

```bash
./bin/gridmap2rects < ./maps/arena.map
```

will convert a grid map of Arena from Dragon Age: Origins to a Rect mesh, output
to standard output.


# Mesh file format

We use a bespoke mesh file format. A summary of the format is shown below -
see `utils/spec/mesh/2.txt` for the complete specification.

```
mesh
2
[V: int = # of vertices in mesh] [P: int = # of polygons in mesh]
(for each vertex)
    [x: float] [y: float]
    [n: int = number of vertices this vertex is connected to]
    [p: int[n] = array of 0-indexed indices of the mesh's polygons connected to
                 this vertex in counterclockwise order. -1 if obstacle]
(for each polygon)
    [n: int = # of vertices in polygon]
    [v: int[n] = array of 0-indexed indices of the mesh's vertices defining
                 this polygon in counterclockwise order]
    [p: int[n] = array of 0-indexed indices of the mesh's polygons adjacent to
                 this polygon in counterclockwise order, such that the p[1]
                 shares the vertices v[0] and v[1]. -1 if obstacle]
```

The format is whitespace insensitive - tokens can be separated by any kind of
whitespace.
