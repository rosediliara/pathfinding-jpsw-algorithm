Finding cover for connections:

- RConnect and RRefine are going to be used
  - RConnect for query
  - RRefine for refining the edge afterwards
    - Doesn't seem necessary if RConnect can find a path.
  
Connecting subgoals: 
- Only RRefine

RCH:
- Only RRefine


// REFINE
- RRefine(start, goal, & path, append = false)

// BREAK
- FindLastReachableIndex(path, start, goal):
  - FreespaceReachability/Bounded-distance reachability can make use of g_values
  - Safe-freespace-reachability also can do that, but requires a bit more.

// CONNECT
- RConnect(start, can_identify_superset):
  - Finds all direct-R-reachable subgoals from a given node.
  - For generating edges, do not identify superset.
  - When connecting, superset can be identified.
- CanDetectReachabilityOfQueryPoints:
  - If not, then start and goal cannot be connected with RConnect. An RRefine
    check is necessary.

// EXPLORE  
- RExploreFringe (ExploreReachableAreaFringe): 
  - Explore until all fringe vertices are identified.
- SetExploreForward/Backward
- GetFringeNodes/GetExpansionOrder/GetData: For constructing SUB
- GetExistingSubgoals/SubgoalDistances: For constructing SUB + RConnect
  
- DoesFringeNodeExist: Explore until one fringe vertex is found or it is verified
                       that none exists.
       
// VISUALIZE:
- uses subgoal manager, data, expansion order                

// MISC
- IsExplorationComplete: Doesn't seem to be used.
- GetReachableDistance(s,t): Used by query subgoal graph when checking for
  RReachability using RRefine

- GetReachableAreaSize(start, num_reachable, num_direct_reachable)
  
  
TODO: 
- In QuerySubgoalGraph, replace GetReachableDistance + RRefine with a 
  reachability check that also returns distance.
