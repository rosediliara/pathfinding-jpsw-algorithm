Maintains a list of arcs
Maintains a list of first arcs

Query graphs (subgoal graphs) assume the following order of calls:

- Add the start vertex
- Add start edges
- Add goal vertex
- Add goal edges

Goal added to (F)orward or (B)ackward graph and the arcs are either (R)eversed or not
Directed-Forward:         F, R
Undirected-Forward:       F, R
Directed-Bidirectional:   B, !R
Undirected-Bidirectional: F/B, !R

Directed/Undirected-Forward
Start edges: start to node  F
Goal edges: node to goal    R 

Undirected-Bidirectional (store a single graph):
Start edges: start to node  F
Goal edges: goal to node    F

Directed-Bidirectioal
Forward graph:
Start edges: start to node  F
Goal edges: none            -

Backward graph:
Start edges: none           -
Goal edges: goal to node    F



Start edges are always forward edges (originate from the start).
Goal edges can be forward edges (originate from the goal)
